# ADB Backup to TAR Converter

This tool provides a simple Windows GUI application to convert Android ADB backup files (.ab) to .tar files. Currently, it does not support password-protected backups.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Java 14 or higher (must be added to the environment PATH)

## Usage

1. Ensure that both Python 3 and Java 14 (or higher) are correctly installed and added to the system's environment PATH.
2. Place the `abe.jar` file in the same directory as this tool.
3. Run the application and follow these steps:
   - Click on the "Convert" button.
   - Wait for the conversion process to complete. A command prompt window will open showing the progress.
   - Once the conversion is finished, your .ab file will be converted to a .tar file.

## Notes

- This tool is designed for Windows environments.
- Support for Linux will be added in a future release.
